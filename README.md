# resume

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the resume in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a static, production version of the resume:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> Uses [adapter-static](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static) to build static version
